It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                        As a means of encouraging participation during Hacktoberfest 2018, this project targets those relatively new to the open source ecosystem and programming in general, but are eager to learn and improve their creative skills by contributing to projects on GitHub.
                        By creating issues that require easy to complete tasks, we are providing a platform where beginners can readily join the open source movement without being overwhelmed with the restrictions and complexities that they may encounter when trying to contribute to already established open source projects for the first time. We hope that newcomers will find it easier improve their skills and grow their confidence as they continue to contribute to projects like this.
                        Welcome to the world of Open Source.

                        <p>
                            Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio.
                            <br>
                            Registered participants who make Pull Requests to public repositories on GitHub throughout the month of October qualify for a limited edition T-shirt. Contributions as small as bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating.
                            <br>

                    <h4>What is Open Source?</h4>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The term 'open source' refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.
                            <br>
                            The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs. Today, however, 'open source' designates a broader set of values—what we call 'the open source way.'
                            <br>
                            Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development. <a href='#' target='_blank'>Read More...</a>
