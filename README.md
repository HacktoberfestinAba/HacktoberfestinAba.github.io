## Hacktoberfest Details
We ask all participants to read through the details to ensure that the global community is working towards a shared goal. Thanks for honoring the values and following the rules of participation.

### Values
As we enter our fifth year, we present the Hacktoberfest values. These have been crafted by you, the community, through your actions and stories. All we have done is highlight them.

Everyone is welcome! - Participants in Hacktoberfest represented 119 countries and thousands of skill sets (all unique). This program welcomes everyone already in the open source software community, and anyone who is interested in diving in.
Quantity is fun, Quality is key - Participating in Hacktoberfest leads to personal growth, professional opportunities, and community building. This all starts with meaningful contributions to open source software.
Short term action, long term impact - In the open source software community, we are standing on the shoulders of those who came before us. Your participation has a lasting effect on people and technology long after October. This is a voyage, not a race.

## Participation Details
Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you’re a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you’re welcome to participate.
Pull requests can be made in any GitHub-hosted repositories/projects. As long as the project is public and GitHub-hosted, your PRs will count towards your participation
You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your PRs to count.

## Participation Rules
To get a shirt, you must make five pull requests (PRs) between October 1–31 in any timezone. PRs can be to any public repo on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted. The PR must contain commits you made yourself. PRs reported by maintainers as spam or that are automated will be marked as invalid and won’t count towards the shirt. This year, the first 50,000 of you can earn a T-shirt (compared with 30,000 in 2017).

### Completions
Quality Standards
In line with Hacktoberfest value #2 (Quantity is fun, Quality is key), we have provided examples of the quality standards we encourage. This applies mainly to beginners.

- PRs that are automated e.g. scripted opening PRs to remove whitespace / optimize images.
- PRs that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a PR.
- PRs that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.

Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your PR count for October.
Last but not least, one PR to fix a typo is fine. 5 PRs to remove a stray whitespace... not.

## What Is Hacktoberfest
Hacktoberfest is an event celebrated in October by Github and DigitalOcean based on the German festivity Oktoberfest.
The main purpose of this event is to stimulate open source contributions on Github by rewarding users tha participate with at least 5 Pull Requests with a T-Shirt.
